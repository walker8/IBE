/* Remap normal yacc parser interface names (yyparse, yylex, yyerror, etc),
   as well as gratuitiously global symbol names, so we can have multiple
   yacc generated parsers in gdb.  Note that these are only the variables
   produced by yacc.  If other parser generators (bison, byacc, etc) produce
   additional global names that conflict at link time, then those parser
   generators need to be fixed instead of adding those names to this list. */
