LIBICAL -- an implementation of iCalendar protocols and data formats

Most of the code in here was written by Eric Busboom with help from
dozens of contributors.  It is currently maintained by Art Cancro
and Wilfried Goesgens.

libical is available for you to use under your choice of the Mozilla
Public License (MPL) v1.0 or the GNU Library General Public License
(LGPL) v2.1.

This dual license ensures that the library can be incorporated into
both proprietary code and GPL'd programs, and will benefit from
improvements made by programmers in both realms.  We will only accept
changes into the library if they are similarly dual-licensed.

Portions of this distribution are Copyright (c) 1997 Theo de
Raadt.  See the header for libical/vsnprintf.c for the full
copyright statement.

IMPORTANT: This is not the complete libical library, just the parts
required for vCalendar plugin of Claws Mail and further bugfixes.
